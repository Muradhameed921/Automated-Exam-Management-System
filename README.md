# Automated Exam Management System

## Overview
The **Automated Exam Management System** is a Python-based project that efficiently manages student seating arrangements and faculty allocation for exams using the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm. This system is designed to handle exam logistics for students from multiple disciplines and batches while optimizing seating plans and faculty assignments.

## Features
- **Student Data Processing:** Collects and preprocesses student information from different batches and disciplines.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Groups students based on their domains and batch numbers.
- **Seating Plan Generation:** Allocates students to available rooms considering seating capacity constraints.
- **Faculty Assignment:** Assigns faculty members to exam rooms based on their expertise and student clusters.
- **Reporting:** Generates detailed reports on seating arrangements and faculty allocation.
- **User Interface:** Provides an easy-to-use interface for administrators to input data and view assignments.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib (for visualization)
  - Tkinter (for GUI, if applicable)

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/muradhameed59/Automated-Exam-Management-System.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```sh
   cd Automated-Exam-Management-System
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the Project:**
   ```sh
   python main.ipynb
   ```
2. **Upload Student and Faculty Data:** The system will process and organize the data.
3. **Generate Seating Plan:** The clustering algorithm will create optimal seating arrangements.
4. **Assign Faculty:** Faculty members will be assigned based on student domains.
5. **Review Reports:** Seating plans and faculty allocations will be available for review.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Correctness:** Accurate implementation of K-Means clustering.
- **Efficiency:** Optimal seating allocation without exceeding room capacities.
- **Faculty Assignments:** Proper assignment based on expertise.
- **Code Quality:** Clean and well-documented code.
